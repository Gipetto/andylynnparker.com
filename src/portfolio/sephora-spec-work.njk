<h2>Sephora Spec Work</h2>

<p>When I first moved to San Francisco, I <strong class="strong">really</strong>, <strong class="stronger">really</strong>, <strong class="strongest">really</strong> wanted to work at Sephoraâ€™s corporate HQ writing ad copy. So I designed and wrote the copy for these ads to submit with my application. I may have gone overboard with the alliteration.</p>
