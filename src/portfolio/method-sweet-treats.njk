<h2>Method Sweet Treats</h2>

<p>One of the joys of writing for Method is spending time in the lab smelling all the latest scents.</p>

<p>The company launches limited edition products about four times a year. I wrote product and packaging copy for a few, including this Sweet Treats collection.</p> 

<p>The website features copy about the collection and product (hand washes are grouped together) as well as each scent.</p>
