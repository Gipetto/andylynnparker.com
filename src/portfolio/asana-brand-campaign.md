## Brand Campaign

In January of 2020 Asana launched its biggest brand campaign ever. We ran print ads in the New York Times and Washington Post. We took over digital billboards in Times Square. We covered the walls of the Montgomery Street BART station in San Francisco. Our ads appeared on buses, at bus stops, on billboards, and on the sides of buildings across Fog City. And, of course, we created tons of digital ads. While an agency did most of the work, I wrote the headlines and brand manifesto featured here.

**Fun fact:** all the people in the ads are Asana customers.
