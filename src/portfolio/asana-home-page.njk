<h2>Asana.com</h2>

<p>To overhaul the companyâ€™s homepage, I worked closely with the creative director, the head of web experience, the CMO, and of course my design partner. Ultimately, I landed on a simple strategy for copy: to draw visitors into the product. This homepage aims to show the audience how Asana solves the problems they care about most. This version of the site was active for about four years (2019-2022) before being redesigned.</p>
