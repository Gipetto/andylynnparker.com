# Merry & Bright Photo Ornament

I love the challenge of writing about odd and obscure products—like everyday items that aren't especially interesting (toothpaste, body wash, vitamins, for example). Or products that I'd never buy.

For the two Christmas tree ornaments I included here, I wanted to draw an emotional connection between the product and the experiences it brings to mind.


# Silver Plate Love Photo Ornament

# Flash Sale! Custom Playing Cards

I'll admit, I got a little carried away with this copy. But rather than write something bland, or something expected (like "durable and made from card stock"), I wanted to tempt consumers with something unexpected and delightful.


# Method Laundry Detergent - Sunset Breeze

If you're familiar with Method, you know the company champions a brand voice that's weird and wonderful. Sometimes it's very effective. And sometimes it's easy to get carried away. But no question it's one of the qualities that sets Method apart. So are the scents. Often I found some so enchanting, it was easy to use sensory words to seduce customers. Others, like the one featured here, inspired me to appeal to the reader's imagination.


# Daily Shower Cleaner

When Method made its best selling Daily Shower cleaner available in one of customers' favorite scents, the company used this fun hangtag to promote it in stores. 

    Lime + sea salt was first introduced to customers as a limited edition scent. It sold out. In fact, customers loved it so much they campaigned to bring it back. And so Method did. This hangtag was put on bottles to promote it in stores.


# All-Purpose Cleaner

During my tenure at Method, honeycrisp apple was introduced as a limited edition scent. It's since made it's way into the lineup of regular smellers. While I didn't pen this product copy, I did write the description of the scent.


# Easy Dose It

Method loves a good pun. This ain't one of them. The body copy is good, but the headline, well, it stinks. And, ultimately, the creative director rejected it. It was the right call.

But if I've learned one thing over the years, it's that my failures often teach me more than my successes. So I'm gonna share them, too.
